# README: Akhil Gunda's Agentic AI Personal Representative

## Introduction

Digital professional profiles are often static and impersonal, limiting genuine connections and failing to capture a candidate‚Äôs essence in conversations with potential employers. **Imagine an AI you can interact with‚Äîone that authentically represents your experience, skills, and ambitions.** This project is a pioneering example: it launches an agentic AI chatbot that acts as a dynamic, interactive proxy for Akhil Gunda, empowering future employers and collaborators to engage directly and meaningfully.

**This AI agent is live and available for public engagement via Hugging Face Spaces:**
üëâ [Ask Akhil anything](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AkhilGunda16/career_conversation) ‚Äî anyone can chat and interact with the agent now.
